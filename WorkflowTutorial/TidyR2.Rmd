- The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages for manipulating tidy data
- They do not necessarily extend functionality beyond base R but they do make things easier and faster:
    - consistent syntax
    - consistent output
    - amenable to piping

- Tidy data (AKA long data) vs. compact data (AKA wide)
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(tibble)
suppressWarnings(library(tidyr))

wide <-tribble(
  ~Gene, ~Sample1,  ~Sample2,
  "Gene1", 473,  526,
  "Gene2", 7203,  6405,
  "Gene3", 59487, 51467
)
long <- gather(wide, "Sample", "Value", -Gene)
wide
long
```

- Each variable you measure should be in one column.
- Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row.
- There should be one table for each "kind" of variable.
- If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked.
